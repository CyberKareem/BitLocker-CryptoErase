.SYNOPSIS
    BitLocker Cryptographic Erase Script for NIST 800-88 rev.1 Compliance

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs a cryptographic erase on all internal drives using BitLocker,
    ensuring data is permanently deleted and unrecoverable in accordance with
    NIST Special Publication 800-88 Revision 1 guidelines.

    WARNING: THIS WILL MAKE DATA IRRECOVERABLE
    * Requires TPM 1.2+ and BitLocker capability
    * Must perform COLD shutdown after execution
    * For use only on systems being decommissioned or repurposed
