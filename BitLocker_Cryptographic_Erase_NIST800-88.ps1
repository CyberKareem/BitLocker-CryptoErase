# BitLocker Cryptographic Erase Script for NIST 800-88 rev.1 Compliance
# This script will use BitLocker to perform a cryptographic erase on all internal drives,
# ensuring data is permanently deleted and unrecoverable.

# Requires -RunAsAdministrator
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Performs a cryptographic erase using BitLocker, compliant with NIST 800-88 rev.1.

.NOTES
- THIS WILL MAKE DATA IRRECOVERABLE
- Requires TPM 1.2+ and BitLocker-enabled drives.
- Must perform COLD shutdown after execution.
